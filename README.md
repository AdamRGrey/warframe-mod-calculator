# warframe-mod-calculator

WAAAY back in the day, in warframe you would level up mods by "fusing" it with another mod. 
There were a few types of mods that were just "cores", they didn't do anything alone, they couldn't be equipped, 
you just used them for fusion. Each type would level up a given mod a certain amount. 
Other than cores, you could fuse any mod. The exact same mod was best (but don't waste one you've leveld up at all), 
then mods with the same polarity, then other mods. 
(and of course there were legendary cores, which just fully level up a mod. They're still around, but there's a finite amount.)

The point of this thing was to be an android app that would let you input a mod's current level and a goal level, 
and it would tell you how many cores (and credits) it would take to get there, broken down by rare/uncommon/common fusion cores,
same polarity non-fusion cores, and different polarity non-fusion cores.

But all that is in the past. Now you can break down a mod into "endo", or just pick endo up. 
You couldn't make use of this project if you wanted to. (And IMO the endo system is better, so yay)
